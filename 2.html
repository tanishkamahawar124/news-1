        <p>The Delhi court has extended Aaftab Poonawala's police custody by five days and granted the police permission for a narco-analysis test of the accused.</p>
        <p>Chaos ensued at Delhi's Saket Court on Thursday as scores of lawyers gathered outside the courtroom, demanding the death penalty for Aaftab Amin Poonawala, the accused killer of his live-in partner Shraddha Walkar. Slogans like “Shraddha ke hatyare ko fansi do, fansi do" (hang Shraddha's killer) were raised by the lawyers just as the judge agreed to take up applications filed by the Delhi Police.</p>
