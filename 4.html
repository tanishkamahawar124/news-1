        <p>Jairam Ramesh said he spoke with Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) leader Sanjay Raut on the Savarkar row and got assured that it won't impact the alliance.</p>

        <p>it has nothing to do with the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on Friday. He said he spoke to Sanjay Raut on the issue and asked him whether this will weaken the alliance that the Congress had entered into with the Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and the Nationalist Congress Party in 2019 and Sanjay Raut said, 'no'. The row comes as Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra is in Maharashtra â€“ the birthplace of Savarkar. Uddhav Thackeray was invited to the yatra but he did not join while his son, former Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray joined the yatra and walked along with Rahul Gandhi.</p>
